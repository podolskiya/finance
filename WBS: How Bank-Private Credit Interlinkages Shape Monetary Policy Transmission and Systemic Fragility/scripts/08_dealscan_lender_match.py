08_dealscan_lender_match.py
----------------------------
PURPOSE
    Match DealScan's Lender_Parent_Name/Lender_Parent_Id entities to
    the RSSD bank IDs in the Call Report panel, so DealScan loan-level
    records can eventually be joined to L_it. This is a NAME-MATCHING
    step only -- it produces a candidate-match review file, it does
    NOT automatically finalize matches. Bank name matching always
    needs a human to confirm the candidates (fuzzy string similarity
    alone will produce both false positives -- similarly-named but
    different institutions -- and false negatives -- genuinely the
    same institution under very different naming conventions).

    KNOWN COMPLICATION (see conversation notes): DealScan's
    Lender_Parent_Name reflects the CURRENT corporate structure
    applied retroactively to historical loans (e.g. "Truist Financial"
    appears as the parent for SunTrust Bank loans from 2010-2012,
    years before Truist existed as a merger of BB&T and SunTrust in
    Dec 2019). This script only produces a NAME match; a separate,
    later step is needed to build a TIME-AWARE crosswalk mapping each
    DealScan parent to the RSSD ID that actually existed at each
    loan's date, once we know which banks match at all.

INPUT   data/raw/dealscan_lenders.csv     (Lender_Parent_Name, Lender_Parent_Id
                                            -- distinct list, from WRDS DealScan)
        data/clean/panel_clean.csv         (rssd9001, rssd9017 -- from 02_linkage_index.py)

OUTPUT  outputs/table_dealscan_match_candidates.csv   (all candidates, for review)
        outputs/table_dealscan_match_summary.txt      (match-rate summary)
        outputs/dealscan_match_log.txt

MATCHING METHOD
    Normalizes both name sets (uppercase, strips common legal-entity
    suffixes: INC, CORP, CO, LLC, LP, N.A., NA, THE, at start/end only
    -- not mid-string, to avoid corrupting names where these appear as
    real words). Uses rapidfuzz token_sort_ratio (handles word-order
    differences, e.g. "Bank of Hawaii" vs "Hawaii Bank") to score every
    DealScan lender against every panel bank, keeping the top 3
    candidates per lender for manual review.

REVIEW WORKFLOW
    Open table_dealscan_match_candidates.csv. For each dealscan_name,
    confirm (or reject) the top candidate:
    - score >= 90: usually a safe accept, but still eyeball it
    - score 75-89: needs a real look (common for legal-suffix
      differences, abbreviations, or genuinely different banks with
      similar names)
    - score < 75: likely no match in your 194-bank sample (most
      DealScan lenders are NOT in your Call Report panel -- large
      non-bank lenders, foreign banks, insurers, asset managers, etc.
      are expected and should be excluded, not force-matched)
    Add a "confirmed_rssd9001" column as you review; send the reviewed
    file back and the next script will use only confirmed rows.
